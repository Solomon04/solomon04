# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

My tech journey began in high school when I founded FAVR, a marketplace for tasks and chores, sparking my interest in tech solutions. Though it didn't last, the experience paved my way into software engineering, enabling me to dive deep into both front-end and back-end technologies without formal qualifications.

- **[Icodestuff](https://icodestuff.io)**: I create and share programming tutorials across various platforms, growing a community of over 20,000 followers interested in modern web technologies.
- **[Popus Gives](https://popus-gives.com)**: As a Fractional CTO, I developed a fundraising platform from scratch, incorporating advanced payment integrations and deployment strategies.
- **Professional Roles**: At Petfinder, I led the integration of a GraphQL gateway to modernize their system architecture, and at Google Next, I developed key front-end components for high-visibility projects.
